# Project-Fliar-Hackmerced2020
An app that scans flyers(or any image captured from your camera) and retrieves the details of an event and is intended to import the event details into Google Calendar.
## Inspiration
We wanted to cut down on the time it takes to input events into a calendar service such as Google Calendar since it can be time-consuming to manually input the details of an event. Flyers also require a lot of ink and paper so this app aims to address all those needs by reducing the amount of materials needed to distribute flyers in addition to making schedule-planning more efficient.

## What it was intended to do
Our app was supposed to scan an image taken from the camera, scan it for event details such as event name, date, start/end time, and location, and then import all that extracted data into a Google Calendar event.

## What it does
Our app scans an image taken from the camera, allows the user to crop it, and extracts text to output back to the user.

## How we built it
We used Android Studio to build the app since it provided the necessary tools to make the app, configure it the way we wanted, and it utilized Java, a language we were all familiar with. Our image to text scanner came from the Google Mobile Vision library dependency provided in Android Studio.
